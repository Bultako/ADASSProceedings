overleaf instructions


- url checker for the \url{} ?
- need Finish.py

- get email from the paper?

- get author from the paper
   (this was the makedefs file can be written)

- the commented
  %\aindex{}      for author index
  %\ssindex{}     for subject index
  %\ooindex{}     for ASCL


- primary author's page number in index should be boldfaced.
  do we need a special \aindexbf{} for this?
